# ESP32 Serial Line IP (SLIP) Project

## Overview

This project implements Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) on an ESP32 microcontroller, enabling IP communication over serial lines. SLIP is an encapsulation of the Internet Protocol designed to work over serial ports and router connections. It allows you to connect the ESP32 to a network over a serial interface, making it ideal for IoT applications where Ethernet or Wi-Fi connections may not be available.

## Features

SLIP Protocol Implementation: Provides a lightweight IP communication method over serial lines.
IP over Serial: Enables network communication using standard IP protocols over serial connections.
Configurable Baud Rate: Supports various baud rates for serial communication.
ESP-IDF Framework: Built using Espressif's IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF), ensuring robust and reliable operation.
Easy Integration: Simple to integrate with existing ESP32 projects or use as a standalone network interface.
